        <h2>BRIEF</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>My 'Exploring Indentity' module in university involved developing a personal brand. We were required to consider all aspects of a personal brand, including tone of voice, typography, visual identities and a set of brand guidelines in order to establish an image that would represent you. Finally we had to tie everything together and consider how our personal brand would be displayed as an personal portfolio website.</p>

<h2>APPROACH</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Before jumping into the deep end there were alot of things to consider. I needed to ensure my personal brand conveyed exactly who I am and what I do. The visual identity aspects I considered were a monogram, wordmark and visual marque. The main dominant asset for my brand was the visual marque. I decided to take an illustrative approach to communicate my personal style and interests. The marque acts as a storyteller into the brands identidy, linking to my personality and my work. The marque is a flat design, a style which is kept consistent throughout the brand. For my monogram and wordmark I opted for for a clean, professional, quite bold, angular approach.</p>

    <p>After I had designed all branding material I had to identify which elements to display on my portfolio site and how. During the developement I used a number of techniques to document my ideas and showcase the components I wish to include on my website. I completed sketches, <a class="element" href="http://martine-mcgrath.tumblr.com/post/143764074401/element-collage-after-my-first-element-collage-i">element collages</a> and a webpage listing a set of <a class="guidelines" href="http://martinemcgrath.github.io/brand-guidelines/brand-guidelines.html">brand guidelines.</a>  </p>

    <h2>FINISHED OUTCOME</h2> 
        <hr>
    
    <p>I went on to design and develop a single page website that offers information about me, my portfolio and contact details. I included a fixed navigation bar with a smooth scroll effect implimented to allow users to navigate between different sections with ease. I decided to base my webpage around the brands visual marque, using the illustrated elements to keep the webpage consistent and successfully communicate the brand.</p>
